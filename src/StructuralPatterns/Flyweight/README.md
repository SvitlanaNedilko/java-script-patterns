# Flyweight Pattern

The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that is used to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. This is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that share common data.


## Real-World Use Cases

2. Graphic Editors (Shapes) - Managing a large number of graphical shapes with similar attributes in a graphic editor.
3. Network Connections (TCP/IP) - Managing a large number of network connections with similar configuration settings.
4. Game Development (NPCs and Terrain) - Managing a large number of non-player characters (NPCs) or terrain tiles with shared attributes in a game.
5. Document Management (Images and Icons) - Managing a large number of image or icon references in a document management system.
