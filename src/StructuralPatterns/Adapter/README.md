# Adapter Pattern
A structural design pattern that allows you to make one interface or object work with another that has a different interface

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **Integration with Third-Party APIs:** When working with third-party services or APIs, there might be a situation where they have a different interface compared to your application. Using an adapter allows you to create a layer of abstraction that transforms API calls into a format understandable by your application.
2. **Migration to New Interfaces:** When updating third-party libraries or frameworks, their interface may change. To avoid direct changes in your codebase, you can use an adapter for a smooth transition to the new interface.
3. **Testing Code:** In testing, there's often a need for mocks or dummy objects that behave like real objects but have a simplified interface for testing. An adapter can serve as a mock, providing the necessary interface for testing.
4. **Data Aggregation:** When you have data from multiple sources with different formats or structures, an adapter can be used to transform this data into a unified format, simplifying further processing and analysis.
5. **Code Refactoring:** When refactoring large codebases, there may be a situation where you want to change the interface of existing classes but don't want to make changes everywhere they are used. Using an adapter allows you to maintain the old interface for compatibility with existing code while implementing the new interface for new code.
