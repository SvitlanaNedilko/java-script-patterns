# Bridge Pattern

The Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern that separates the abstraction from its implementation so that they can vary independently. It aims to decouple an abstraction (such as an interface or an abstract class) from its implementation (the methods or functionality provided by concrete classes).

## Components of the Bridge Pattern:
1. **Abstraction:** This defines the interface or abstract class for the higher-level layer of abstraction. It maintains a reference to an object of the Implementor interface.
2. **Implementor** This interface provides the contract for concrete implementors (classes) to follow. It defines the methods that will be implemented by concrete implementor classes.
3. **Refined Abstraction:** This is an extension of the abstraction that can add additional methods or functionality specific to its context.
4. **Concrete Implementor:** These are the concrete classes that implement the Implementor interface. They provide the actual implementation of the functionality defined by the Implementor interface.

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **GUI frameworks** where the abstraction represents the user interface elements (buttons, windows, etc.) and the implementor represents the underlying platform-specific code.
2. **Database access layers** where the abstraction represents the data access methods (CRUD operations) and the implementor represents the specific database management system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
3. **Remote controls for electronic devices** where the abstraction represents the control interface (buttons, switches) and the implementor represents the actual device being controlled
