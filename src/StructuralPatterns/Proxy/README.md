# Proxy Pattern

The proxy pattern in JavaScript is a design pattern used to create a placeholder or surrogate object to control access to another object. This pattern is useful in a variety of real-world scenarios. 

## Real-World Use Cases
1. Lazy Initialization: Only loading or initializing an object when it is actually needed. 
2. Access Control / Protection: Restricting access to certain properties or methods.
3. Logging and Auditing: Logging interactions with an object for debugging or auditing purposes.
4. Validation
