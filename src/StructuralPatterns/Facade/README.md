# Facade Pattern

The facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. This pattern can be very useful in TypeScript for creating a single point of interaction for a complex set of APIs, libraries, or systems. Here are some real-world use cases for the facade pattern in TypeScript

## Real-World Use Cases
1. Simplifying API Interactions - Provide a simple interface for interacting with multiple third-party APIs.
2. Managing Complex Libraries - Create a simple interface for using a complex set of graphics libraries
3. Streamlining Database Operations - Provide a unified interface for interacting with multiple databases.
4. Simplifying UI Component Interactions - Provide a facade for interacting with various UI components in a consistent manner.
5. Coordinating Complex Workflows -  Provide a facade for managing complex business workflows that involve multiple subsystems.


## Similar patterns:
----------
Both the Facade and Adapter patterns provide a simplified interface to a complex system or a set of interfaces.

The Adapter pattern is primarily used to make an existing interface compatible with another interface. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting one interface to another.
The Facade pattern provides a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, without altering the interfaces themselves.
----------
Abstract Factory and Facade : they provide a way to work with complex systems, they serve distinct purposes and are used in different contexts.

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's used to create a suite of products that are designed to work together.

The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It aims to make a subsystem easier to use by offering a unified and straightforward interface.
