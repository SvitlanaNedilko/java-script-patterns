# Decorator Pattern

The decorator pattern in TypeScript is a powerful tool for adding behavior to classes and class members in a declarative manner.

## Real-World Use Cases

1. Logging - Automatically log method calls and their parameters for debugging purposes.
2. Validation - Validate the parameters of a method to ensure they meet certain criteria.
3. Access Control - Restrict access to certain methods based on user roles.
4. Caching - Cache the results of method calls to improve performance.
5. Dependency Injection - Automatically inject dependencies into class constructors.
