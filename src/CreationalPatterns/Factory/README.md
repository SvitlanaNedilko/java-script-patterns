# Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. In JavaScript, it's commonly used in scenarios where you need to create different sets of related objects based on some conditions, configurations, or contexts.

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **Database Abstraction:** Factory can help in creating database-specific objects (such as connections, queries, or transactions) tailored for different database management systems, without tightly coupling the application to a particular database vendor.
2. **Game Development:** In game development, Factory can assist in creating various game elements (such as characters, weapons, or environments) depending on the game's genre or level design.
3. **Localization:** Factory can facilitate the creation of locale-specific objects (such as date formatters, currency converters, or language resources) to support multilingual applications.
4. **Testing Environments:** Factory can aid in generating mock objects or stubs for testing purposes, allowing developers to simulate different scenarios or conditions easily.

## difference

The Abstract Factory pattern allows creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is used to create groups of objects.

The Factory Method pattern is used to create one object within one class. It allows subclasses to decide which specific object to create.

AbstractFactory not used in JavaScript declares an interface for creating or being created.
Although the term "abstract" may be absent in the context of JavaScript, the idea of creating interfaces or methods for object creation is a widely used practice that reflects the concept of the "Abstract Factory."

In JavaScript, we often use interfaces, objects, or functions that act as "abstract," declaring methods that need to be implemented in concrete classes or objects.
