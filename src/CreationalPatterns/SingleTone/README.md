# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern is a design pattern used to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In JavaScript, the Singleton pattern can be useful in various scenarios where you want to restrict instantiation of a class to a single object and provide a way to access that object globally. Here are some real-world use cases for the Singleton pattern in JavaScript:

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **Logger:** In a logging system, you might want to ensure that there's only one instance of the logger throughout your application to centralize logging functionality and avoid creating multiple log files or conflicting logs.
2. **Configuration Manager:** You might use a Singleton to manage application configuration settings to ensure that there's only one instance holding the configuration values throughout the application's lifecycle.
3. **Database Connection:** In scenarios where you need to ensure that only one database connection exists throughout the application, you can use the Singleton pattern to manage the connection.

A pattern similar to the Singleton pattern is the "Module" pattern. While not identical, it shares some characteristics with the Singleton pattern in that it provides a way to encapsulate functionality into a single instance and provides a mechanism for global access.
In the Module pattern, you create a self-contained module that encapsulates private data and exposes a public API for interaction. This pattern is commonly used in JavaScript to create reusable components and maintain clean code organization.
