# Iterator
The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows sequential access to elements in a collection without exposing the underlying representation. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to traverse different types of collections in a uniform manner

## Real-World Use Cases
1. Custom Collection Traversal: You have a custom collection (e.g., a collection of songs) and you want to provide a way to traverse through the collection.
2. Tree Traversal: You want to traverse a tree structure (e.g., a file system) in a uniform way.
3. Database Result Set Traversal: You have a database query result set, and you want to iterate through the rows of the result set
4. Aggregation of Different Collections: You want to aggregate multiple different collections and iterate through them in a uniform manner.
