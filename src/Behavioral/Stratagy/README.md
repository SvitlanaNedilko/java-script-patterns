# Strategy

The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It allows defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. This pattern is particularly useful when you have multiple ways to perform a task, and you want to make the algorithm or strategy interchangeable.

## Real-World Use Cases

1. Payment Processing in E-Commerce
   Context: An e-commerce application where customers can choose different payment methods at checkout, such as credit cards, PayPal, or cryptocurrency.
   Strategies:
   CreditCardPayment: Processes payment using credit card details.
   PayPalPayment: Processes payment using a PayPal account.
   CryptoPayment: Processes payment using cryptocurrency.
   Behavior: The payment method can be selected at runtime based on the user's preference, allowing for flexible payment options without changing the checkout process.

2. Sorting Algorithms in a Data Processing Application
3. Compression Algorithms in a File Storage System
   Context: A file storage system that supports different compression algorithms to reduce file size, depending on the file type or the user's choice.
   Strategies:
   ZipCompression: Standard compression, suitable for general-purpose files.
   RarCompression: Offers better compression rates, suitable for larger files.
   GzipCompression: Fast compression, commonly used for web assets.
   Behavior: The system selects the appropriate compression strategy at runtime, depending on the file type or user preferences

4. Travel Route Calculation in a Navigation System
   Context: A navigation system that provides multiple routes to a destination, allowing the user to choose the route calculation strategy (e.g., fastest, shortest, scenic).
   Strategies:
   FastestRoute: Calculates the route with the shortest travel time.
   ShortestRoute: Calculates the route with the least distance, regardless of time.
   ScenicRoute: Prefers routes with scenic views, possibly avoiding highways.
   Behavior: The user can select the preferred route calculation strategy at runtime, providing flexibility based on their travel preferences
