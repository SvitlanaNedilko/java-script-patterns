# Template

The Template pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but allows subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain steps of the algorithm. This pattern is useful when you have a general process that can be customized by subclasses while ensuring that the overall structure of the process remains unchanged

## Real-World Use Cases

1. Data Processing Pipeline
   Context: In data processing applications, different types of data may require similar processing steps (like reading, transforming, and writing), but the specifics of each step may vary.
   Template Class: DataProcessor
   Concrete Classes: CSVDataProcessor, JSONDataProcessor
   Behavior: The base class defines the structure for processing data, while subclasses implement specific logic for reading, transforming, and writing data based on the format.
2. Game Development (Game Loop)
   Context: Many games have a common game loop structure, including initialization, input handling, updating game state, and rendering. However, the specific implementation of each step can vary based on the game.
   Template Class: Game
   Concrete Classes: PlatformerGame, RPGGame
   Behavior: The base class defines the game loop, while subclasses provide implementations for specific game mechanics.
3. Report Generation
   Context: In business applications, generating reports often involves a common structure, such as data retrieval, formatting, and exporting. Different types of reports may require different implementations of certain steps.
   Template Class: ReportGenerator
   Concrete Classes: SalesReportGenerator, InventoryReportGenerator
   Behavior: The base class defines the steps for generating a report, while subclasses implement specific logic for each report type.
4. User Authentication
   Context: User authentication systems can have a common structure, but different types of authentication (like password-based, OAuth, or biometric) may require specific implementations.
   Template Class: AuthenticationTemplate
   Concrete Classes: PasswordAuthentication, OAuthAuthentication
   Behavior: The base class defines the authentication flow, while subclasses implement specific details for each authentication type.
