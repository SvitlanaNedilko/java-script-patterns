# State

The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It helps manage state-specific logic in a cleaner way by encapsulating the state-related behavior in separate classes.

## Real-World Use Cases

2. ATM Machine (Card Inserted, Pin Entered, Withdraw Money States)
