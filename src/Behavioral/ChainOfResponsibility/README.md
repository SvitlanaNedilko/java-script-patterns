# Chain of Responsibility
The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows request handling to be passed along a chain of handlers. Each handler can either process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern is useful for scenarios where multiple handlers can handle a request and the specific handler is determined at runtime.

## Real-World Use Cases
1. Event Handling: In a GUI application, various components need to handle events like clicks. Each component should have the chance to process the event or pass it to the next component.
2. Logging: You want to log messages at different levels (info, debug, error), and each level can decide whether to handle the log or pass it to the next level.
3. Form Validation: You have a form with multiple fields, each needing different validation. Each validator can handle the validation for its specific field or pass the request to the next validator.
4. Middleware in Web Servers: Implementing middleware in a web server where each middleware component can process the request, modify it, or pass it to the next middleware.
