# Mediator

The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling by ensuring that components communicate through a mediator rather than directly with each other. This pattern is useful in scenarios where many-to-many relationships exist between interacting components, making the system easier to maintain and extend

## Real-World Use Cases

1. Chat Room Application: A chat room where multiple users can send messages to each other. Instead of each user knowing about other users and sending messages directly, a mediator (chat room) handles the message broadcasting.
2. GUI Component Interaction: In a graphical user interface, various components like buttons, text fields, and checkboxes need to interact with each other. Instead of each component interacting directly, a mediator handles the interactions.
3. E-commerce System: In an e-commerce system, different modules like order processing, inventory management, and payment processing need to communicate with each other. Instead of having direct communication, a mediator handles the interactions.
