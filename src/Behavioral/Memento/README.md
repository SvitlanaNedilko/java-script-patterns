# Memento
The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to save its state to be restored later without exposing its internal structure. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing undo mechanisms.

Components of the Memento Pattern
Memento: The object that stores the state of the Originator.
Originator: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
Caretaker: Manages the mementos and interacts with the Originator to save and restore states.

## Real-World Use Cases

1. Text Editor Undo/Redo Functionality: A text editor that allows users to undo and redo their actions.
2. Game State Management: A game where the player's state (level, score, etc.) can be saved and restored.
3. Form Input State Management: A web form where users can undo/redo their input changes.
